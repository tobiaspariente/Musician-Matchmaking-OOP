FINAL PROJECT - "THE SOUND OF STRINGS AND KEYS"

General Description:

The name of my programme is a play on words with guitar and piano: THE SOUND OF STRINGS AND KEYS.

This program is for all beginners who are not able to find a model to follow.

What does my Python program:

My Python program allows a musician who plays the guitar or the piano to know which musical celebrity his or her profile most closely

resembles.

General steps:

The user just has to fill in some information about himself and he gets a list of about 20 musicians who are most like him.

The result:

This list is sorted from most to least similar.

In addition, the user can also ask for a surprise choice and he will get a random name of an artist chosen from the database.

Feedback from myself:

This program is first of all fun but more seriously allows a musician in search of a model who looks like him.

My Python program was created entirely on my own and without inspiration from the Internet or any other external help.

Rules respect:

This final project respects the CS50 rules of honesty.

I was able to create this code on my own thanks to the teachings of CS50, my program is composed of a main function and 3 additional

functions.

These last 3 are accompanied by 3 test functions.

My program is built without pip libraries but with the python library "random" for the main code, and the python library "unittest" for the

code that tests my functions.

The database:

I created the artist database myself. It contains men and women, guitarists and pianists, from all over the world.

The function find_musicians:

The find_musicians function allows me to sort the user with a note against the database.

The function get_input:

The get_input function simply allows me to ask questions to the user in order to determine his profile.

The main function:

The main function is simple and includes the get_input function too.

The function surprise_choice:

Finally, the surprise_choice function is fun because it allows the user to get a random name from the database.
